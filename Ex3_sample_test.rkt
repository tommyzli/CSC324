#| Sample tests for Exercise 3.
Note the use of the "plai" language to use a more robust
testing framework.

All test expressions are in the form (test <actual> <expected>).

Note: these tests are only a subset of the tests we will run;
you are strongly advised to add to them on your own.

**WARNING**: because we use your functions outside of the tests,
if your functions raise an error, no tests will be run, and you
will get a 0 on this exercise! Make extra sure that your functions
do not raise errors when called.
